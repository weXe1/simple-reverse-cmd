# simple-reverse-cmd

Simple reverse shell-like scripts which you can use for executing commands remotely.

You can start netcat server like this: `nc -lv 127.0.0.1 8000` and then launch one of scripts.

Script connects to the server and after that on the netcat terminal you can type some commands to execute by the shell.
